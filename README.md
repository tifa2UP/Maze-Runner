Maze or Labyrinth Generator and Solver
(see greek mythology: Ariadneâ€™s thread)
The goal of this project is to write a program that will automatically generate and solve mazes. Each time you run the program, it will generate and print a new random maze and the solution. You will use depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS). Submit your code, and also JUnit test cases for it.
Generating a Maze:
To generate a maze, first start with a grid of rooms with walls between them. The grid contains r rows and r columns for a total of r*r rooms. For example, Figure 1 is a 4x4 grid of 16 rooms. The missing walls at the top left and bottom right of the maze border indicate the starting and finishing rooms of the maze.
